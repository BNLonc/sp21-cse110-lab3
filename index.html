                    <h3>Monday, 5 April 2021</h3>
                    <p>
                        On Monday, I had two lectures to watch and one review quiz to do for class. I also caught wind of some in-person rec classes coming back on campus, which had me pretty excited. I signed up for kendo right away hoping to see some of my old friends from before everything went virtual.

                    <p>
                        On Tuesday, I had to miss some synchronous lectures because I had a COVID vaccine appointment at 3:30. The shot itself almost felt like nothing. My dad had told me that it had put him out of commission for five days, but all I felt was a sore left deltoid for a while.

                    <p>
                        On Wednesday, I had a few meetings for AS. We'd just appointed a new FC, who'd be taking the job of running Finance Committee off my hands for the rest of the term. I had a lecture I had to catch up on from Tuesday, but I'd fit that in before crashing at a nice, early 2 AM.
